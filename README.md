Huddle and Chill

Huddle and Chill is a twitter like app where users can post events that they're coordinating and share drop pins and event times so people can meet up and chill while playing sports. I created the app for me and my friends to be able to have enough people to play sports like Volleyball and Badminton outside of the available time frame of our friends schedules. 

Technologies Used

The app is created with the MERN infrastructure which comprises of Mongoose, Express, React, and Node.js
